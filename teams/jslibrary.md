# Microsoft Teams (Preview) JavaScript SDK reference

Reference documentation for the full list of functionality available in the SDK.

>**Tip:** For developers using TypeScript, Microsoft Teams provides a [definition file](https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v0.2/types/MicrosoftTeams.d.ts) to enable IntelliSense or similar support from your code editor as well as compile-type type checking as part of your build.

## `microsoftTeams`
This is the root namespace for the JavaScript SDK.

### `getContext(callback: (context: `[`Context`](#Context)`) => void): void`
Retrieves the current context the frame is running in.

#### Parameters
* `callback: (context: `[`Context`](#Context)`) => void`
    * The callback to invoke when the [Context](#Context) object is retrieved.

### `initialize()`
Initializes the library. This must be called before any other SDK calls. The caller should only call this once the frame is loaded successfully.

### `navigateCrossDomain()`
Navigates the frame to a new cross-domain URL. The domain of this URL must match at least one of the valid domains specified in the tab manifest; otherwise, an exception will be thrown. This function only needs to be used when navigating the frame to a URL in a different domain than the current one in a way that keeps the SkypeTeams app informed of the change and allows the SDK to continue working.

#### Parameters
* `url: string`
    * The url the iframe should be navigated to.

### `registerOnThemeChangeHandler(handler: (theme: string) => void): void`
Registers a handler for when the user changes their theme. Only one handler may be registered at a time. Subsequent registrations will override the first.

#### Parameters
* `handler: (theme: string) => void`
    * The handler to invoke when the user changes their theme.

## `microsoftTeams.authentication`

### `authenticate(authenticateParameters: `[`AuthenticateParameters`](#authentication.AuthenticateParameters)`): void`
Initiates an authentication request which pops up a new windows with the specified settings.

#### Parameters
* `authenticateParameters: `[`AuthenticateParameters`](#authentication.AuthenticateParameters)
    * A set of values that configure the authentication popup.


### `notifyFailure(reason?: string): void`
Notifies the frame that initiated this authentication request that the request failed. This function is only usable on the authentication window. This call causes the authentication window to be closed.

#### Parameters
* `reason?: string`
    * Specifies a reason for the authentication failure. If specified, the frame which initiated the authentication popup will recieve this value in their callback.

### `notifySuccess(result?: string): void`
Notifies the frame that initiated this authentication request that the request was successful. This function is only usable on the authentication window. This call causes the authentication window to be closed.

#### Parameters
* `result: string`
    * Specifies a result for the authentication. If specified, the frame which initiated the authentication popup will recieve this value in their callback.

## `microsoftTeams.settings`
Namespace to interact with the settings view-specific SDK. This object is only usable on the settings frame.

### `getSettings(callback: (settings: `[`Settings`](#settings.Settings)`) => void): void`
Gets the settings for the current instance.

#### Parameters
* `callback: (settings: `[`Settings`](#settings.Settings)`) => void`
    * The callback to invoke when the [Settings](#settings.Settings) object is retrieved.

### `registerOnRemoveHandler(handler: (evt: `[`RemoveEvent`](#settings.RemoveEvent)`) => void): void`
Registers a handler for when the user attempts to remove the content. This handler should be used to remove the underlying resource powering the content. The object passed to the handler must be used to notify whether to proceed with the remove Only one handler may be registered at a time. Subsequent registrations will override the first.

#### Parameters
* `handler: (evt: `[`RemoveEvent`](#settings.RemoveEvent)`): void`
    * The handler to invoke when the user selects the remove button.

### `registerOnSaveHandler(handler: (evt: `[`SaveEvent`](#settings.SaveEvent)`) => void): void`
Registers a handler for when the user attempts to save the settings. This handler should be used to create or update the underlying resource powering the content. The object passed to the handler must be used to notify whether to proceed with the save. Only one handler may be registered at a time. Subsequent registrations will override the first.

#### Parameters
* `handler: (evt: `[`SaveEvent`](#settings.SaveEvent)`): void`
    * The handler to invoke when the user selects the save button.

### `setSettings(settings: `[`Settings`](#settings.Settings)`): void`
Sets the settings for the current instance. Note that this is an asynchronous operation so there are no guarentees as to when calls to getSettings will reflect the changed state.

#### Parameters
* `settings: `[`Settings`](#settings.Settings)
    * The desired settings for this current instance.

### `setValidityState(validityState: boolean): void`
Sets the validity state for the settings. The inital value is false so the user will not be able to save the settings until this is called with true.

#### Parameters
* `validityState: boolean`
    * A value indicating whether the save or remove button is enabled for the user.
