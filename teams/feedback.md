# Submit your questions, bugs, feature requests, and contributions

The Microsoft Team (Preview) product team responds to the developer community across several channels. Please tell us about your:

- **Technical questions:** We listen and respond on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skypedeveloper). Tag your question with "skypedeveloper" so that our team and the Skype for Business developer community can respond with helpful answers.

**TODO: fix up link to new Microsoft Teams tag**

- **API bugs and business (non-technical) questions:** Please contact us via our [Microsoft Teams developer insiders email box](mailto:microsoftteamsdev@microsoft.com). We are on an agile release cadence and will respond quickly to get more information about the bug you are reporting.


- **Documentation bugs:** If you find a bug in the Microsoft Teams SDK documentation, open an [issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-docs/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to tell us which topic is factually incorrect or unclear. To help us fix the problem more quickly, quote the text to be changed. 


- **Sample application bugs:** If you find a bug in one of our samples, open an issue on GitHub. Be sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug.


- **Feature requests:** If our API doesn't empower you to do a feature that you really need, please contact us via our channel for [Skype feedback on the developer platform](http://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/category/120892-developer-platform).

**TODO: fix up link to new feedback portal**

- **Contributions:** We accept pull requests against our SDK documentation and our samples. If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, go to our [Microsoft Teams docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-docs). You'll find a contributors guide that tells you how to create pull requests and what to expect from the Skype for Business team.
